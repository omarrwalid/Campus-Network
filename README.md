# Enterprise Network Simulation: Multi-Router Infrastructure

A comprehensive Cisco Packet Tracer project demonstrating advanced networking concepts with **three routers interconnecting six distinct networks** through strategic subnetting, VLAN implementation, DHCP services, and dynamic routing using RIP.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This enterprise-grade network simulation features a hierarchical design with:
- **3 Cisco Routers** forming the network backbone
- **6 Cisco Switches** serving individual department networks
- **Multiple end-devices** including PCs, servers, and network services
- **Inter-VLAN routing** enabling secure inter-department communication
- **Dynamic routing** with RIP for efficient path selection

## 🔧 Core Technologies Implemented

### IP Subnetting
- Efficient VLSM addressing for optimal IP space utilization
- Six /24 networks subdivided for departmental requirements
- Hierarchical addressing scheme for simplified management

### VLAN Configuration
- Department-based VLAN segmentation (Computer, IT)
- 802.1Q trunking between switches and routers
- Inter-VLAN routing using router-on-a-stick methodology
- Port security and VLAN access control

### DHCP Services
- Centralized DHCP deployment across multiple subnets
- Scope configurations for each VLAN/network
- IP address management and exclusion ranges
- DHCP relay agent configuration where required

### Dynamic Routing
- RIPv2 implementation across all three routers
- Automatic route propagation between networks
- Route summarization where applicable
- Redundant path configuration
